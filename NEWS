Overview of changes in libmbim 1.26.2
----------------------------------------

 * The meson build setup was updated as follows:
   ** Added new 'man' boolean option to allow disabling the generation of man
      pages explicitly; 'true' by default.
   ** Updated the 'introspection' option to be a boolean; 'true' by default.
      This effectively removes the automatic enabling of the introspection
      support based on whether the dependencies are found or not.
   ** Fixed static build failure with toolchains that don't support dynamic
      library.
   ** Add version script linker flag only when available.
   ** Fixed double quotes in udev rules file generated.

 * Added support for a new Quectel service, including the following operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_QUECTEL_RADIO_STATE

 * mbim-codegen:
   ** Explicitly require python3.

 * mbimcli:
   ** New '--quectel-query-radio-state' and '--quectel-set-radio-state'
      operations, which provide a way to FCC unlock EM120 modules in new Lenovo
      laptops.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.26
----------------------------------------

 * Build now requires GLib/GObject/GIO 2.56.

 * The GUdev optional build/runtime requirement is now fully dropped, it's no
   longer used.

 * Building from git no longer requires autoconf-archive, the needed AX_ macros
   are now shipped inside m4/.

 * In addition to building from a source release tarball, or building from git
   checkouts using the GNU autotools suite (autoconf/automake/libtool), this
   release includes the initial support for the meson build system. The meson
   port is not fully complete yet, as there are some missing things in the doc
   generation steps, but for system integration or development purposes, the
   port should be fully operational. This major release, including all its
   stable updates in the 1.26.x series, will be the last ones providing support
   for GNU autotools. The next major release will likely be a meson-only one,
   and will therefore not be based on a source release tarball any more, but
   on specific git tags instead.

 * Implemented new link management operations, exclusively for the cdc_mbim
   driver for now. These new operations allow creating or deleting VLAN network
   interfaces in order to run multiplexed data sessions over one single physical
   network interface.

 * Added support for the Microsoft-defined SAR service, including the following
   operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_SAR_CONFIG
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_SAR_TRANSMISSION_STATUS

 * Added support for the Microsoft-defined UICC Low Level Access service,
   including the following operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_ATR
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_OPEN_CHANNEL
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_CLOSE_CHANNEL
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_APDU
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_TERMINAL_CAPABILITY
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_UICC_LOW_LEVEL_ACCESS_RESET

 * Added support for the Qualcomm-defined QDU service, including the following
   operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_QDU_UPDATE_SESSION
   ** MBIM_CID_QDU_FILE_OPEN
   ** MBIM_CID_QDU_FILE_WRITE

 * Extended the Microsoft-defined Basic Connect Extensions service, including
   the following operations:
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_DEVICE_CAPS
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_SYS_CAPS
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_SLOT_INFO_STATUS
   ** MBIM_CID_MS_BASIC_CONNECT_EXTENSIONS_DEVICE_SLOT_MAPPINGS

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Logic updated to make sure full packets are written at once, instead of
      writing them in chunks.
   ** Updated the "LTE attach status" APIs in order to avoid creating unneeded
      struct types in the interface. The older methods have been deprecated and
      maintained in the library for compatibility purposes only.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** Internal buffer size updated from 512 bytes to 4096 bytes.

 * mbimcli:
   ** New '--ms-set-sar-config' and '--ms-query-sar-config' actions.
   ** New '--ms-set-transmission-status' and '--ms-query-transmission-status'
      actions.
   ** Updated '--enter-pin', '--disable-pin' and '--unlock-pin' to allow other
      PIN types, not just assuming PIN1.
   ** New '--link-add', '--link-delete', '--link-list' and '--link-delete-all'
      actions.
   ** New '--ms-query-sys-caps' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-slot-info-status' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-device-slot-mappings' and '--ms-set-device-slot-mappings'
      actions.
   ** Renamed '--ms-query-lte-attach-status' to '--ms-query-lte-attach-info',
      and kept the old name for compatibility purposes.

 * mbim-network:
   ** When using the mbim-proxy, skip trying to manage the MBIM session and
      transaction ids as that is implicitly done by the proxy already.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.24.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.26.0:

 * Fixed merged subscribe list reporting and handling in the proxy.
 * Fixed transaction id handling when multiple fragments are involved.
 * Fixed read overflows on malformed messages.
 * Skip warnings if descriptors file cannot be read, as in new MBIM backends
   other than cdc_mbim.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.24
----------------------------------------

 * Build now requires GLib/GObject/GIO 2.48.

 * Added new GObject Introspection support in the library, that can be
   explicitly requested during configure with --enable-introspection=yes.
   With the new introspection support, the libmbim-glib library can now be
   used directly from e.g. python programs, as in the example included with
   the release.

 * Added release version information to all the types and methods of the public
   library API, and added new per-version indices in the documentation.

 * Added g_autoptr() support to all public types.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.22
----------------------------------------

 * Build updated with several improvements:
   ** The build has been updated to use by default all warnings enabled by
      AX_COMPILER_FLAGS(), and therefore when building the release from a git
      checkout, autoconf-archive >= 2017.03.21 is now required. This new build
      dependency isn't required when building from the release tarball.
   ** Also when building from a git checkout, beware because by default
      --enable-compile-warnings=error is enabled, which implies -Werror. If
      you'd like to build from git and avoid -Werror, you should explicitly use
      --enable-compile-warnings=yes (to keep the warnings but without being
      errors), --enable-compile-warnings=no (to disable all the extra warnings
      enabled by default) or --disable-Werror (to unconditionally make all
      compiler warnings non-fatal).

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Message parsing logic improved to avoid reading fields out of bounds, e.g.
      if the messages sent by the modem are malformed or not in line with the
      specs.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.20.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.22.0:

 * libmbim-glib: fixed handling of fragmented indication messages.
 * mbimcli: added --query-provisioned-contexts.
 * mbim-proxy: fix logic when symlinks to cdc-wdm ports are used.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.20
----------------------------------------

 * Build updated with several fixes:
   ** Explicitly define max allowed GLib version.
   ** Fix issues with -Werror=type-limits.
   ** Made compiler warning options compatible with clang.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** Fixed client subscription to service indications using wildcard.
   ** Fixed client subscription update logic when services/cids are being
      removed.
   ** New '--empty-timeout=[SECS}' option to specify the empty lifetime
      duration.
   ** New '--no-exit' option to avoid the proxy from exiting.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.18.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.20.0:

 * mbim-proxy: default empty lifetime set to 300s.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.18
----------------------------------------

 * Build now looks for the correct python provider in the system during
   configure.

 * New Microsoft Basic Connect Extensions service, that includes new commands to
   manage Protocol Configuration Operations (PCO) as well as LTE attach status
   and settings.

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Added support to fully print all message contents, including all fields,
      when traces are enabled.
   ** Added support for QMI indications over MBIM.
   ** Added additional cause codes to MbimNwError.
   ** Fixed signal emission in device, so that it's done before completing
      transaction task.

 * mbim-proxy:
   ** Fixed the management of subscribed events, so that the lists are
      maintained per-device.

 * mbimcli:
   ** New '--ms-query-pco' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-lte-attach-configuration' action.
   ** New '--ms-query-lte-attach-status' action.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.16.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.18.0:

 * mbimcli:
   ** Fix SNR reporting in --atds-query-signal output.
   ** Longer timeout (60s) in --disconnect.
   ** Add "ip-type" property to --connect

 * libmbim-glib:
   ** Fix printing message in Intel Firmware Update service.
   ** Fix error reporting when unknown status.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.16
----------------------------------------

* Build now requires GLib 2.36.

* All the code base was ported to use the GTask based asynchronous operations
  support instead of the deprecated GSimpleAsyncResult.

* New AT&T Device Service support, that includes operator-specific commands to
  query signal info or cell location.

* New Intel Firmware Update Service support, that includes commands to request
  the Intel-based module to reboot in firmware download mode.

* libmbim-glib:
  ** Added MBIM_STATUS_ERROR_CONTEXT_NOT_SUPPORTED to MbimStatusError.
  ** Avoid using iconv() directly for the UTF-16BE conversions, which makes it
     possible to use libmbim on systems with a stub iconv() implementation.
  ** Added support to detect already open MBIM channels on the Sierra Wireless
     EM7345.

* mbimcli:
  ** New '--query-ip-packet-filters' action.
  ** New '--query-pin-list' action.
  ** New '--atds-query-signal' and '--atds-query-location' actions.
  ** New '--intel-modem-reboot' action.

* Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.14.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.16.0:

* libmbim-glib:
  ** Prefer realpath() to canonicalize_file_name().
  ** Added MBIM_READY_INFO_FLAG_NONE to MbimReadyInfoFlag.

* mbim-proxy:
  ** Avoid receiving signals from the parent process.

* mbimcli:
  ** Add cancellability to the query-ip-configuration action.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.14
----------------------------------------

* New support for the 'QMI over MBIM' service, so that clients can use libqmi to
  build messages and libmbim to transport them.

* The GUDev library, which we use to read the max message size from the USB
  descriptor, is now optional. When configuring, it will be used by default only
  if it's found. It can also be explicitly disabled using the new configure
  switch '--without-udev' or explicitly enabled using '--with-udev'. If GUDev
  isn't used, libmbim-glib will rely on sysfs directly.

* libmbim-glib updates:
  ** Added support for building messages of custom services.

* mbim-network updates:
  ** Added support for loading profiles from different paths using the new
     '--profile' option. This makes it possible to use mbim-network with
     multiple devices running in the same system.
  ** Added support to allow specifying APN user (APN_USER), password (APN_PASS)
     and authentication type (APN_AUTH) in the profile.
  ** Added support to allow using the mbim-proxy setup by configuring it in
     the profile file (PROXY=yes).

* Several other minor improvements and fixes.

The following features which were backported to 1.12.x releases are also present
in libmbim 1.14.0:

 * mbimcli updates:
   ** Updated '--connect' arguments to allow specifying "key=value" pairs. The
      old legacy "[(APN),(PAP|CHAP|MSCHAPV2),(Username),(Password)]" format is
      kept as valid for backwards compatibility, although it should be assumed
      deprecated.
   ** Longer timeouts for connect/register operations.
   ** Report IP configuration when connected.
   ** Allow specifying session ids.

 * libmbim-glib updates:
   ** Probing retry interval increased to 5s.

Overview of changes in libmbim 1.12
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-mbim-username' option during configure, which allows specifying
  which will be the user owning the /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all MBIM
  modems (udev rules are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
  used, the mbim-proxy will only allow connections from processes running by the
  specified user or by the root user.

* Function error messages can now be returned by the MbimDevice as responses to
  `Command', `Open' or `Close' messages. Users of the library should not assume
  the type of message returned to the previous actions.

* The MbimProxy will monitor for 'NotOpened' errors, and when one detected it
  will directly close the internal MbimDevice. Any subsequent request sent by
  clients to that specific device will be aborted with a proxy-generated
  'NotOpened' error. Clients will need to explicitly reopen the ports in that
  case.

* The API now has a new mbim_message_response_get_result() method which allows
  getting a GError from a message which may be of a specific type (e.g. a
  `Command Done' message in response to a `Command' request) or instead the
  generic `Function Error' message type. Users of the library can use this new
  method to avoid assuming the type of message returned.

      E.g. the following check:
          mbim_message_command_done_get_result (response, &error);
      Can be updated as:
          mbim_message_response_get_result (response,
                                            MBIM_MESSAGE_TYPE_COMMAND_DONE,
                                            &error);
      And the same logic can be applied to `Open' and `Close' messages.

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
  ** Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
  ** Fix bashisms in the mbim-network script.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.10
----------------------------------------

 * API break: Flag values in 'MbimRegistrationFlag' were updated to match the
   ones in the MBIM documentation.

 * Implemented a new 'mbim-proxy', which allows sharing a single MBIM control
   port among different processes. The usage of the proxy is optional, and can
   be requested by specifying the MBIM_DEVICE_OPEN_FLAGS_PROXY flag in the new
   mbim_device_open_full() method. The 'mbimcli' command line tool was also
   extended with a new '--device-open-proxy,-p' option, to allow requesting the
   use of the proxy process.

 * New 'removed' signal added to the MbimDevice, to notify when the underlying
   connection to the device is lost (e.g. lost connection to the mbim-proxy, or
   lost access to the MBIM control port).

 * Added support for registering and using custom services.

 * Added additional GMM cause codes to MbimNwError.

 * Transactions are now matched not only by ID but also by type.

 * Several other minor improvements and fixes.


Overview of changes in libmbim 1.8

    --set-radio-state
    --ms-query-firmware-id
    --ms-notify-host-shutdown
    --dss-connect
